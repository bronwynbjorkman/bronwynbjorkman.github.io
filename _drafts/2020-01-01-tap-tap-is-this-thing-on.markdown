So I have a new website, and a new domain, and a new blog! Sometimes I get the itch to remember how much I've forgotten about how CSS works, and a few days later the result is something like this: an entirely static website + blog, created with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/). 

It seemed appropriate to get it up and running for the new year, so here we are! 

I don't yet know what kind of content you'll be likely to find here. So far I've populated the archives with the one "miscellaneous" item I had on my old website: [a guide to how we webcast THEY2019]({% post_url 2019-06-30-thoughts-on-webcasting %}). 

Because it's the new year and I'm setting things up for the coming term, though, this seems like an opportune moment to write a bit about my bullet journal and how I use it to think about organization and projects. 

If you don't know what bullet journalling is, you may be able to work it out by ostension from the rest of this post, but you may also prefer to visit [the original explanation](https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn). 

This seems to be an obligatory kind of post for anyone who has both a bullet journal and a blogâ€”and I certainly understand why. Technically all you need for a bullet journal is some kind of notebook + a writing utensil, but like so many others I am partly in it for the stationery. I use an A5 Leuchtturm 1917 notebook with dotted pages, and a 0.38mm Uniball Signo DX pen.

I like the usual things about the Leuchtturm notebook: the built in table of contents, the printed page numbers, the two bookmark ribbons, the nice paper. If you like extremely fine-tipped pens (but not so fine tipped that they're eternally breaking down) I recommend this one highly. And what was wonderful for me about starting a bullet journal is that for the first time I actually *use* one of the lovely blank journals I own, without worrying that I was "wasting" the pages.

My current bullet journal habits involve weekly, monthly, and 6-month forecasts, and (usually) daily lists. The weekly and 6-month forecasts are pretty straightforward:

The benefit of the 6-month forecast is in sitting down and visualizing what's happening in the long term. 

Monthly spread + pipeline

It's also where I keep notes for research meetings, and any other miscelleanous jottings I care to make.  not where I keep informaton about deadlines

If you are so incautious as to google "bullet journal", you might reasonably conclude that the system is only usable by people who have time to draw delicate little studies of the day's weather forecast, or beautiful calligraphy headers, Every Single Day. Bullet journalling is built around rapid logging, an index, and a series of spreads. 

(The very coolest part, if you don't mind my saying so, is that the [Talks](/talks.html) and [Papers](/papers.html) pages are automatically generated from a YAML file. My delight in the result might finally be enough to get me to figure out how to write bibtex styles.)
