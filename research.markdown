# Research

(This page is under construction)

My research focuses on the morphology, syntax, and semantics of tense and aspect, particularly expressions of anteriority (past, perfect, and perfective) and their representations in terms of syntactic features.

I am also more broadly interested in how information is represented and manipulated in terms of features, for example in case and agreement, and in the mechanisms underlying phenomena often described as "grammaticalization". In the past several years I have been involved in a number of projects looking at language variation and change, through the use of large-scale corpora. 

I also work on topics in morphophonology, especially the morphological conditioning of phonological alternations, and on the syntax and semantics of coordination, especially asymmetric coordination.
