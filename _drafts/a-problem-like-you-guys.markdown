[Originally written on September 17, 2018, in my green bujo, as a draft post for the hypothetical "Social Justice Warrior Language Log" blog that never got off the ground]

Contemporary Standard English famously lacks a distinction between singular and plural in the second person.  

But almost as famously, "non-standard" varieties of English are forever innovating new second person plural pronouns—<i>y'all</i>, <i>yinz</i>, <i>yous</i>, and similar—or else simply retain singular <i>thou</i>. All of these address an ambiguity that exists in the standard pronoun inventory, though one that doesn't cause as much confusion as you might otherwise expect, particularly in comparison to the more frequent confusion caused by generic uses of *you*, evident so often in the refrain of "you, well not *you*-you, you know, just (waves hand around) you". 

A linguist friend of mine once put forward the claim that *all* English speakers had a singular-plural distinction in the second person, whether innovated or retained. His, he suggested, was <i>you guys</i>. I claimed that I was a counter-example to his generalization. "I don't have <i>you guys</i> as a pronoun," I protested, "and I definitely don't have any other second person plural form!"

To this day, I'm confident that <i>some</i> English speakers genuinely lack a morphological number distinction in the second person. But within a couple weeks of that exchange (which took place sometime in 2017) I was forced to admit that <i>I</i> at least was not among them, because I did in fact have a pronoun <i>you guys</i>, because I caught myself saying (as one does when one is a linguist) the possessive form "<i>your guys's</i>". 

Let us pause to really consider that for a moment: <i>your guys's</i>. As anyone who has grappled with the pronominal system in English will agree, it is a fairly garbage system, and gets worse in the face of any syntactic complexity. But still: **your guys's**. That's a doubly marked possessive, with the semi-irreguar second person possessive *your*, and possessive "'s" being pronounced as a full [əz] (for at least some speakers, myself among them) even though it follows a word (*guys*) that at least <i>looks</i> like it ends in the regular plural suffix *-s*. The plural ending on *guys* is relevant because in other contexts the genitive and the plural collapse together in a convenient haplology (for at least some speakers, including me), so that the possessor in a phrase like "<i>the horses' tails</i>" is pronounced as [hɔrsəz] rather than as [hɔrsəzəz]. Indeed, the form [jɔrgajzəz] doesn't exactly trip merrily off the tongue. 

In short, what struck me as soon as I noticed myself saying this is that the only possible reason to produce this tragedy of a morphological car-crash is if your internalized grammar of English backs you into a corder where [jɔrgajzəz] is the only possible  form. 

GOT HERE

But the morphosyntactic half of this blog post doesn't end there, because I started to notice that for all its determination to force a very odd morphological paradigm, *you guys* isn't a very good *pronoun*. 

An astonishing amount of modern syntactic attention has been paid to pronouns, especially when you consider hwo little we still know about them and how thoroughly at least two major Enlgish players have typically been overlooked. But still, we have a fairly good description of the distribution of non-reflexive pronouns via the well-known Principle, B, defined as in \NEXT by so-and-so

Principle B

In line with this principle, examples like (1) are good (Because "she" and "her" are in spearate clauses), while examples like (2) are bad ("she" and "her" are too close together). 

(1) She said you already met her. 

(2) *She saw her in a mirror. (cf. herself)

What about "you guys"? Unsurprisingly, it is bad in contexts like (2), which require a reflexive—and it is not too implausivel that the reflexive of "youguys" might be "yourselves". 

(3) ??You (guys) saw you guys in the mirror (cf. 'yourselves)

BUy "you guys" is in fact odd in any context where it's c-commanded by another instance of a co-referring pronoun: 

(4) You guys said she already met you guys. 

This is perhaps not ungrammatical, but it is certainly odd in a way that (1) is not. 

The relevant relation does not seem to be one of c-command, as we can see by looking at cases where 'you guys' is repeated across multiple sentences in a small discourse, as in (5): 

(5)  You guys should tell a story! Tell us the one where (??you guys / you) accidentally stole a dog! 

(Perhaps going straight to discourse would be some of your's first instinct! And here we find another bit of evidence that English pronouns don't know what to do near 's) 

Based on not particularly rigorous attention to my own patterns of use, it would seem that "you guys" is limited to a first mention---basically, the contexts where we find full nominals natural rather than pronouns.
