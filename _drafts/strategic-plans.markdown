One or two times a year I succumb to the idea that if I can only figure out *exactly* the right organization / tracking / project management system, I will miraculously triple my productivity and also do away with 90% of my anxiety.

The last few rounds of this, I have tried to develop and then implement a Strategic Plan. People who successfully do this rave about the process. And the appeal is obvious! Who *wouldn't* want to map out a plan that helps structure your work life and that seems to promise more productivity with less stress?

So several times now I have sat down to write about my goals, and think about how those goals do or do not align with my current projects, and how I might better align them, and what this might look like over the next however many months. And then I make an appointment with myself to check back in about how everything is going next Sunday afternoon or whatever, and I manage to do that once or maybe twice, and then it just... stops.

I say "it" there as though I am not, in fact, the person who stops. 

The process just... does not work for me. None of them! And this is not through a lack of willing, I sit down and faithfully write about my goals and think about how my goals relate to my projects, and what I can do to better align them, and then I make an appointment with myself to check back in about how everything is going next Sunday afternoon or whatever, and then it just... stops.
