<h2>Teaching Development and Resources</h2>

As a member of <em>Teaching Introduction to Linguistics Community of Practice (TILCoP Canada)</em> I've been involved with the creation of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/word-to-the-whys-podcast/home"><i>Word to the Whys</i></a> podcast, created as an accompaniment to any Introduction to Linguistics course.
<p>
When teaching <i>Introduction to Linguistics</i> remotely in the 2020-2021 academic year, I created a series of content videos and accompanying "topic guides". Since these represented a considerable investment of time and energy, I've decided to make both available online, under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0</a> license! Anyone is free to use or adapt them for their own teachingâ€”if this spares anyone work when teaching a similar course, especially anyone employed in a more precarious position than I am, I will be delighted.

<h2>EGG 2014  (University of Debrecen)</h2>

In 2014 I taught two courses at the European Generative Grammar summer school, at the University of Debrecen.

<ul>
  <li><em>The Representation of Aspect</em>
      <ul>
        <li> Topic: the relationship between viewpoint aspect and situation aspect, their syntactic representation in terms of features, and how that representation can interact with other syntactic phenomena such as case assignment.
        <li> Handouts:
            <ul>
              <li> <a href="/assets/courses/Bjorkman_EGG14_Aspect1.pdf">Handout 1: Introduction</a>
