	<h2>About Me</h2>

	I'm an Associate Professor at <a href="http://www.queensu.ca/">Queen's University</a>, where I teach in the Linguistics program. I am also the Head of the <a href="http://www.queensu.ca/llcu/linguistics/">Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures</a>.
	<p>
	My research focuses on the morphology, syntax, and semantics of verbal inflection, particularly tense and aspect. I'm interested in how information is represented by <b>features</b>, and how features mediate between realization (in morphology) and interpretation (in semantics). I'm also interested in the relationship between morphological and phonological representations, specifically the question of how much  phonology "knows" about morphological structure.
	<p>
	I received a B.A. in linguistics and philosophy from McGill University in 2006, and I completed my Ph.D in linguistics at <a href="http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/">MIT</a> in September 2011. My dissertation is <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingBuzz/001354">available online from LingBuzz</a>.
