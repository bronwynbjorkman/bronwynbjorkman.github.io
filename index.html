	<h2>About Me</h2>
	
	I'm an Assistant Professor in the <a href="http://www.queensu.ca/llcu/linguistics/">Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures</a> at <a href="http://www.queensu.ca/">Queen's University</a>, where I primarily teach courses in the Linguistics program.
	<p>
	My research focuses on the morphology, syntax, and semantics of verbal inflection, particularly tense and aspect. I'm interested in how information is represented in terms of <b>features</b>, and how those features mediate between realization (in morphology) and interpretation (in semantics). I'm also interested in the relationship between morphological and phonological representations, specifically the question of how much access phonology has to information about morphological structure. 
	<p>
	I received a B.A. in linguistics and philosophy from McGill University in 2006, and I completed my Ph.D in linguistics at <a href="http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/">MIT</a> in September 2011. My dissertation is <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingBuzz/001354">available online from LingBuzz</a>.
