Hot take: being an avid consumer of science fiction makes you a better linguist

I think everyone who works on the semantics of tense should be required to read a lot of science fiction.

Not *required*-required, obviously. I'm not going to take away anyone's semanticist card.

Enthusiasm for science fiction is just incredibly useful for a theoretical linguist. Not required, obviously—and more's the pity—but just truly, fundamentally useful.

Being able to easily come up with new imaginative contexts against which to evaluate sentences is super useful.

Nowhere is this more visible, at least for me personally, than in the semantics of tense. In the real world, the temporal difference between past and future is inseparably bound up with the epistemic difference between the knowable and the unknowable. This means that even in languages that have a genuine *tense* used to talk about things that will happen in the future (not including English, where the future is expressed with the same grammatical means as obligations or possibilities), there is an asymmetry in what types of relationships a person can have to past vs. future events.

Enter the power of science fiction!

Is language about describing the world as it actually is? Definitely not. Now, I'm a philosophical idealist, by which I mean that I don't think our perception of the world tells us very much about the world as it "objectively" exists (if it "objectively" exists). Given that background, it would be basically impossible for language to describe the world as it exists.

Dream contexts.
