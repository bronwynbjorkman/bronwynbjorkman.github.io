But arewe debating the same issues that we were twenty-five years ago? Perhaps not.</p>      <p>&#8226;What        impact does the undeniable need for the mastery of English have upon        Frenchin Quebec?<br>&#8226;How can we prepare our children for the reality of English's near-universal use,nurturing French as a native language while also bringing up our children tobe &quot;citizens of the world?&quot;<br>&#8226;Could bilingual education be considered as a means to give Quebecers thetools to play a more important role in the international community?</p>      <p>The panel  discussion was organised by Society of Linguistics Undergraduates of  McGill and the Political Science Students' Association, and was followed by        a French-English bilingual question period and an informal reception        where discussions  continued.</p>      <p><strong>Panelists:</strong></p>      <p><span class="stronggold">Nadia Br&eacute;dimas-Assimopoulos, President, Conseil sup&eacute;rieur        de la langue fran&ccedil;aise, Government of Qu&eacute;bec</span> <br>        The Conseil sup&eacute;rieur de la langue fran&ccedil;aise is one of        the organisations created by the Charte de la langue fran&ccedil;aise.        Its role is to consult with the minister responsible for the application        of current laws on any question  pertaining to the French language in Qu&eacute;bec. In doing so, the Conseil  advises the minister on any topic the latter may present it with and brings  forward issues that it considers require the government's attention.</p>      <p><span class="stronggold">Mela Sarkar,    Associate Professor, Faculty of Education, McGill University </span><br>    Professor Sarkar is an associate professor in the department of integrated    studies at McGill University. Currently, she is focussing on the acquisition    of French    (as a first and as a second language) by both child and adult minority-language    speakers in Montreal classrooms. Her work draws on the classroom-centered    second language acquisition research tradition and has implications for educational    planning and policy decisions in Quebec, especially for French second language    curriculum design and teacher training. Having studied and worked in Quebec,    she has acquired knowledge regarding educational policies in Quebec.</p>      <p><span class="stronggold">Denise      Daoust, Professor Emeritus, Linguistics, UQAM </span><br>      Professor Daoust's fields of study include language planning and the sociology      of language (French and English). She has specifically looked at language      in the workplace, examining sociological, communicational and psychosocial      factors      such as age, attitude and perception, regarding both languages as well      as francisation. Among her numerous publications are &quot;The Evaluation      of Sociolinguistic and Terminological Change in a Commercial Enterprise&quot; and &quot;A      Decade of Language Planning in Qu&eacute;bec&quot;.</p>      <p><span class="stronggold">Alan Patten, Associate        Professor, Political Science, McGill University </span><br>        Professor Patten's interests lie in contemporary, Anglo-American political        theory and the history of political thought. Previously, he has done        research on Hegel's        political philosophy, as well as the relationship between liberalism        and nationalism. More specifically, Professor Patten has written several        papers        pertaining to        issues such as secession and self-determination, the basis for cultural        rights in liberal egalitarian though, and the connection between citizenship        and        national identity. Currently, he is writing a book on language politics        and normative        political theory.</p>      <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></td>  </tr></table></body><!-- InstanceEnd --></html>
